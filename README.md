## 📝 Passwords Tested (Examples)  
> ⚠️ *Note: These are only sample passwords for testing. Do NOT use your real personal passwords.*  

| Password | Strength Result | Estimated Crack Time | Feedback |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|----------|
| `password123` | Weak | Instant | Common word + numbers → easy to guess. |
| `Vedant2025` | Medium | Few hours | Better (mix of letters + numbers) but still short. |
| `V3d@nt_N@gp#re2025!` | Very Strong | Trillions of years | Contains uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and good length. |
| `Coffee$Train!Sunset#Sky2025` | Very Strong | Extremely long time | Passphrase style → secure + easy to remember. |

## 🔍 Observations & Best Practices  
1. **Length matters** – The longer the password, the harder it is to crack.  
2. **Character variety** – Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols.  
3. **Avoid common words** – Prevents dictionary attacks.  
4. **Use passphrases** – Easier to remember but still secure.  
5. **Don’t reuse passwords** – Different accounts need unique passwords.  
6. **Use a password manager** – Helps store and generate strong passwords.

## ⚔️ Common Password Attacks  
- **Brute Force Attack**: Tries all possible combinations until success.  
- **Dictionary Attack**: Uses pre-collected lists of common words/passwords.  
- **Phishing Attack**: Tricks users into revealing their passwords.  

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways  
- A strong password = **long + complex + unique**.  
- Password managers + multi-factor authentication (MFA) increase security.  
- Weak passwords can be cracked in seconds, while strong ones can take **centuries or longer**.
